# pybvh
Python library to work with bvh files

The main point of this library is a Bvh class, which contains all the necesseray information found in a bvh file.
Through the use of this object, it is easy to read and write a bvh file, but also to convert it to a Pandas Dataframe, and conversely to transform a Dataframe into a bvh object.

See the tutorials folder for example of use. 

Futur goal includde transforming to graph data, as well as transform the angles directly (different Euler angle order, transformation to rotation matrix etc.)
